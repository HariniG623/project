      <h2>About UDILIV 300MG TABLET 15'S </h2>

      <p>
        UDILIV 300MG TABLET 15'5 (UDCA) is a naturally occurring bile acid
        derived from the bear bile, and it is also produced synthetically. It
        has been used for several decades as a therapeutic agent to manage
        various liver disorders. UDCA is primarily known for its
        hepatoprotective properties and is used in the treatment of gallstones,
        primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and other chalestatic liver
        conditions. This bile acid works by reducing cholesterol absorption,
        improving bile flow, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects, thereby
        promoting liver health.
